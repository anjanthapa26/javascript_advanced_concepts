//Functional programming helps us be more declarative 


// Imperative vs Declerative 

// Imperative tell
// what to do and how to do it 
for(let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}

// jquery is also example of imperative 






//Declerative 
// what to do and what should happen

[1,2,3].forEach(item => console.log(item))

// React
